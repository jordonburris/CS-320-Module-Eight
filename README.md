Module 8

How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
  - I can ensure my code is functional and secure by running tests throughout the development process. 
How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
   - The way I interpret user needs is by starting out with an overline or list that I will make sure I complete during the development process.
How do I approach designing software?
   - Like I stated in the previous question, I start out with a list of what I would like the program to do, then I will start to make an outline with the code, and getting the basic constraints written out. After that I will start my main development and do little bits of testing during development, that way when I get finished I will not have an surprise errors.
